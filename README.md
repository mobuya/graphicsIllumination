# Computer Graphics | May24

This project was done as a part of the Foundations of Computergraphics course at Univeristy of Vienna. In this project, I developed a simple, interactive 3D application using JavaScript. The focus was on implementing graphics routines and managing geometry, rotation, translation, and user interactions. Additionally, I explored and applied various shading and illumination models.

Achieved full points.

Example of Phong Specular Illumination:
